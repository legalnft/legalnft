<h1>Whats is LegalNFT ?</h1>

LegalNFT is a Dapp that helps NFT minters and buyers get legally protected. 


<h2>What problem does it solve ?</h2>

When you mint a NFT and you are ready to sell it for millions, what exactly are you selling ? Will the buyer have the right to modify your work ? Can he commercially exploit it, without you touching a cent on it ?

If you want to purchase a NFT, what exactly are you buying ? Is the creator conceding you enough rights, worth the price you're paying ?


<h2>What is the solution ?</h2>

LegalNFT lets NFT minters generate a personal licensing agreement tied to their NFTs. While simple, the contract adds some much needed legal certainty for creators and allow them to focus on selling their art without being fully legally compromised.

For wanna-be buyers, LegalNFT serves as a "Licensing agreement explorer" for NFTs. With one click, they can instantly get access to the license agreement that the NFT's creator has created. This way, they can have a good glimplse of what they will legally acquire.


<h2>How does it work ?</h2>

There are 2 services. One is for the NFT's minters and the other is for buyers.

First, minters get to do a simple questionnaire that is going to fill a license agreement template according to their answers. If the person who is interracting with the Dapp is indeed the NFT's creator (the programs checks it via OpenSea API), then the legal contract is generated, sent to an IPFS node, and the address is stored in a mapping in the ethereum blockchain.

Then, anybody can put the NFT address and the token ID into the dapp, and they will be able to check the nft's license agreement.


<h2>Evolution</h2>

The smart contract which stores the ipfs addresses of the licenses is deployed to ethereum ropsten. When the optimism or Arbitrum will be on mainnet, the smart contract will be deployed on their network so it will be cheaper for NFT minters to store their license agreement.
